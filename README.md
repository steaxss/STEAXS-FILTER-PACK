## üÜï Changelog

To see in detail the changes over time, it is here :


## Filters description

- **Filter "0 - AGRESSIVE UNIVERSAL"** - For players who want a more or less universal filter, very bright and colorful as well.

- **Filter "1 - SMOOTH UNIVERSAL"** - More suitable for streamers and people who don't want to make big changes to their game (chill players or beginners).
Personally, I do not recommend using this filter on Coldwind Farm.
This filter is streaming-friendly so you can use it to beautify your stream without killing the viewers' eyes.

- **Filter "17 - SMOOTH COLDWIND"** - Same as "smooth universal" but suitable on coldwind farm for streamers.
