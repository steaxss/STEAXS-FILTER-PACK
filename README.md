I will take your feedback seriously and you will help me to improve this pack further !

Please do not DM me to make custom filters, I don't do that, even for money sorry ! (I am particularly referring to competitive players).

## Filters description

- **Filter "0 - AGRESSIVE UNIVERSAL"** - For players who want a more or less universal filter, very bright and colorful as well.

- **Filter "1 - SMOOTH UNIVERSAL"** - More suitable for streamers and people who don't want to make big changes to their game (chill players or beginners). Personally, I do not recommend using this filter on Coldwind Farm. This filter is streaming-friendly so you can use it to beautify your stream without killing the viewers' eyes.

- **Filter "17 - SMOOTH COLDWIND"** = Same as "smooth universal" but suitable on coldwind farm for streamers.
